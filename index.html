                   Hey I am Melanie Akinyi. I am a software engineer, creative thinker and someone who believes in building tools that make life better. I started out curious about how technology works and that curiosity quickly turned intoa deeppassion for creating. Ftom clean  interfaces to solving real problems in communities. I have become the type of developer  who does not just write code, I BUILD WWITH PURPOSE. When I am not coding, you will find me exploring design ideas, journaling or dreaming up the next big thing that could help someone out there. I am especially passionate about tech that serves underrepresentedvoices and makes systems more accessible in Africa and beyyond. I am currently on a path to not only grow as a dev, but also as a changemaker, and this site is just a peek into that journey.
