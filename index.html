                   Hey I am Melanie Akinyi. I am a software engineer, creative thinker and someone who believes in building tools that make life better. I started out curious about how technology works and that curiosity quickly turned intoa deeppassion for creating. Ftom clean  interfaces to solving real problems in communities. I have become the type of developer  who does not just write code, I BUILD WWITH PURPOSE. When I am not coding, you will find me exploring design ideas, journaling or dreaming up the next big thing that could help someone out there. I am especially passionate about tech that serves underrepresentedvoices and makes systems more accessible in Africa and beyyond. I am currently on a path to not only grow as a dev, but also as a changemaker, and this site is just a peek into that journey.

                   <h3>Personal website</h3> 
                   <p>This is the website you are currently vviewing. IIt is my first custom project built using html and css.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Corner Auto spares</h3>
                    <p>This is a website for an automotive spare parts shop. I am planning to tweak it and turn it to an ecommerce site but in the meantime it is just a site about the shop. Some more pages are yet to be added.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Professional card</h3>
                    <p>This is a digital professional card that holds thhe owners information. I created oone for one of our technical mentors, Solomon KItonyi. It has his name, his profession, his skills and links to his porrtfolio, github and linkedIn</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Ride sharing app</h3>
                    <p>The idea to this was to build a ride sharing app like bolt or uber but the difference would be that the app was meant for regions around kisii, migori, homabay and their surrounding regions.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Stuctify Designs</h3>
                <p>This would be a web application meeant for botth architects and clients looking to build homes. Architects would have a platform to post their designs to be viewed by potential clients.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Mehost Management</h3>
                <p>This would be a  project beneficial to university students and the landlords around the universities. It would be a site for sttudents to look for and boook hostels they want to live in during their semesters at school. Housing is a big issue for university students since there isnt an online platform, they have always had to go to their uniiversities pphysically to book hostels. With this system, they would just need tto log in, choose a building they  want and then the room they would be comfortable in.</p>
